# Settings Modal Cleanup

## Summary

Removed all training-related settings from the global Settings modal since they have been moved to session-specific settings in `SessionSettingsModal.svelte`.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/lib/components/Modals/Settings.svelte`

**Before**: 537 lines with complex training settings, validation, and state management
**After**: 62 lines with only theme switcher and danger zone

**Removed**:

- Training state selection (Unlearned/Learning/Finished)
- Case group selection (Basic/Advanced/Expert/BasicBack)
- Slot side selection (Left/Right)
- Options (Add AUF, Show Timer)
- Smart frequency settings
- Hint settings (Algorithm Display, Stickering Style)
- Color options (Cross/Front colors)
- All accordions (no longer needed)
- Working state copies and synchronization logic
- Form validation and flash states
- Update/Confirm button logic

**Kept**:

- ✅ Theme switcher (Dark/Light mode)
- ✅ Danger Zone (Clear All Data)

---

## Files Deleted

### 2. `src/lib/utils/trainSettings.ts` ❌

**Reason**: This utility managed saving/comparing training settings for the global Settings modal. Since all training settings are now per-session, this is obsolete.

**What it did**:

- Saved snapshots of training settings
- Compared current vs saved settings to detect changes
- Triggered queue regeneration when settings changed

**Why not needed**:

- Each session now manages its own settings independently
- Session settings are saved directly to `sessionState`
- Queue regeneration happens automatically when switching sessions

### 3. `src/lib/types/TrainSettings.ts` ❌

**Reason**: Type definition for the global training settings that no longer exist.

**What it defined**:

```typescript
type TrainSettings = {
	trainStateSelection: Record<TrainState, boolean>;
	trainGroupSelection: Record<GroupId, boolean>;
	trainSideSelection: Record<Side, boolean>;
	crossColor: StickerColor[];
	frontColor: StickerColor[];
	trainState: Record<GroupId, Record<number, TrainState>>;
};
```

**Replaced by**: `SessionSettings` interface in `src/lib/types/session.ts`

---

## Impact

### Simplified Code Architecture

- **Removed** ~600 lines of code across 3 files
- **Cleaner separation**: App-level settings (theme, data) vs Session-level settings (training config)
- **Better UX**: Users now configure training per-session, allowing multiple training profiles

### Migration Path

All settings that were in the global Settings modal are now in `SessionSettingsModal`:

| Old Location (Settings.svelte) | New Location (SessionSettingsModal)       |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Statuses                       | Case Selection → Training State Selection |
| Case Groups                    | Case Selection → F2L Groups               |
| Slot Side                      | Training → Slots                          |
| Add AUF                        | Training → Additional Options             |
| Show Tim                       | Training → Additional Options             |
| Smart Frequency                | Training → Case Frequency                 |
| Algorithm Display              | Visuals → Hint Settings                   |
| Stickering Style               | Visuals → Hint Settings                   |
| Cross Color                    | Visuals → Color Settings                  |
| Front Color                    | Visuals → Color Settings                  |

### Benefits

1. **Session Independence**: Each session can have completely different training configurations
2. **Simpler Global Settings**: Only truly global settings (theme, data management) in Settings modal
3. **Less State Management**: No need to sync working copies, validate, or compare snapshots
4. **Better Performance**: Less reactive state, simpler component logic
5. **Clearer Intent**: Settings modal is now obviously for app-level config

---

## Testing

After cleanup, verify:

- ✅ Settings modal opens and shows only Theme + Danger Zone
- ✅ Theme switcher works correctly
- ✅ Clear All Data warning and confirmation works
- ✅ No console errors about missing trainSettingsManager
- ✅ Training settings are accessible via session settings (gear icon in TrainView toolbar)
- ✅ Each session maintains independent training configuration

---

## Files Remaining

The following files still exist and are used:

- ✅ `src/lib/components/Modals/Settings.svelte` - Simplified app-level settings
- ✅ `src/lib/components/Session/SessionSettingsModal.svelte` - Session-specific training settings
- ✅ `src/lib/types/session.ts` - SessionSettings type definition
- ✅ `src/lib/sessionState.svelte.ts` - Session state management

---

## Conclusion

The Settings modal is now focused solely on **application-level configuration** (appearance and data management), while **training configuration** is properly scoped to individual sessions. This provides a cleaner architecture and better user experience! 🎉
